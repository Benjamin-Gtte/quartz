Title: Les oscillations gravito-élastiques de la Terre une invitation à l'étude d'une classe de problèmes spectraux
---
Internal geophisycs.

Important: 
- average density of earth: 5.5, then, we move drastically to 10.
**Geophysical motivations**
- The exterior is considered as solid, and the interior is considered as a liquid, with a big all in the liquid part. Consider that the equilibrium of the ball solid is hydrostatic. 
- suppose that we are in a configuration of stationary equilibrium, and suppose an adiabatic evolution. Then, linearisation of first order of the equation. Main idea: perturbation of strains, perturbation of density, of the field of gravity
- Obtains also the equations of motion for the core, liquid.
- Then, defines the interface solid-liquid equations. 
- Finally, computes the dynamic evolution in the rotational configuration, with an external excitation: spectral excitation.
**The excitation leads to generalised spectral problems**
- $\mathcal{X}$: Banach space
- para-closed space: $D \subseteq \mathcal{X}$: $D$ is injected continuously within $\mathcal{X}$ (=$D\mapsto \mathcal{X}$ is continuous). The paraclosed topologie is unique.
- Consider $l: D\to\mathcal{X}$ closed: it means that its graph is closed in $\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}$. 
- ==A closed space + a borned space is always a closed space==
- Define the [[Fredholm operator]] and the semi-Fredholm operator	![[Pasted image 20241121112721.png]]
- **Two key results** Consider a closed operator
	- ==Generalised Weil criterion==
	- [[Schur decomposition]] If, in a Banach space, if we have the luck of having a decomposition of $D=D_1\oplus D_2$ and $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{X}_1\oplus\mathcal{X}_2$, this leads that the operator $L$ can be decomposed as a multiplication of two triangle matrices and a diagonal matrices. 
- [[quotient topology]]

- Definition of the operator of elasto-gravity, using the representation theorem of Kato
