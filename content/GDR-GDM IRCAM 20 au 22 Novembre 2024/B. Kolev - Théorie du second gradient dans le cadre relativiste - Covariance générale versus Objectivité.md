Title: Théorie du second gradient dans le cadre relativiste - Covariance générale versus Objectivité
---
- The idea is to describe the relativistic hyperelasticity with the ===variational relativity of Souriau===. 
- Consider a Lagrangian depending on the ==$k$-jet== of variables considered, noted $j^k_m$ ($k$-jet on variable $m$). 
- ==General covariance==: every Lagrangian is invariant by any diffeomorphism (not invariance by change of coordinates which is not the same definition).
- ==Perfect matter== by Souriau: a function from the universe the the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$.
- Define the ==body==. 
- Introduce a reference in the universe, called the **material frame** $\mathcal{F}^{mat}$. 
- What is the ==conformation== ? It is the push forward of the inverse of the metric. It is an invariant of general relativity $K(\varphi^*g, \varphi^* p) = K(g,p)\circ\varphi$ . 
- **This idea of construction of invariants of general relativity, we have ;**
	- **for any tensor define on the universe, we construct its contravariant version**
	- **define its definition with respect to the material frame**
	- **show that it is an invariant of general relativity.**
- This theory can lead to a definition of the ==Classical theory of gradient fluids==
**Introduction of an observer**
- In mechanics, we need to define time and space, we define a function from the universe to the real numbers, defining a ==folliation== (a space time structure, or structure 3+1).

- The **key idea is the decomposition of the time as a direction of the flux of matter and the direction of displacement of the observer.**  We have to frames, one linked to the matter, the other to the observer. If observer and matter are the same, then we are not in relativity. 
- ==Killing vector==
**Limit problem**
- need to define a Galilean structure on the universe, a pair of contravariant symmetric tensors (spatial co-metric), and a 1-form which is the clock.
- The conformation tends to the inverse of the right Cauchy Green tensor, the relativistic material acceleration tends to the eulerian acceleration.
- In this theory, we start from a Lagrangian which is covariant general. At the limit, we observe that some invariants are objectives, and some not.
