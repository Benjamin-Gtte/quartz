**Key idea**
How to geometrise Thermodynamics
- temperature is a vector $W$
- entropy is a vector $S$
- energy becomes a tensor $T$
- gravitation is a covariant derivative $\nabla$ 
**Background**
- ==C. Eckart==: first principle is the divergence of the impulse-energy tensor equal to zero.
- ==Landau and Lifshitz==: decomposition of this tensor into a reversible and an irreversible part + link between the entropy vector and the temperature $S = TW$.
- ==Souriau 1976==: the divergence of the entropy vector is greater or equal to zero.
**Relativity**
- an event occurs at a position and a time. 
- The ==Galilean transformations== are space-time transformations preserving inertial motions, durations, and distances. Their set is Galileo's group, a Lie group of dimension 10.
- A former symmetry group would be the group of ==Lorentz-Poincaré==. 
- **Work with a dimension 5**
- Consider a $\mathbb{R}$-principal bundle, and a section. They build.a group of affine transformation, Galilean when acting onto the space-time.

- Consider ==Bargmannian transformations==, setting the Bargmann's group, which is very useful in thermodynamics. 
**Temperature, friction, and momentum tensor**
- The temperature is a 5-vector, a ==Bargmannian== 5-vector. 
- Introduce the friction tensor, the gradient of the temperature vector. This object merges the temperature gradient and the strain velocity. 
- Momentum tensor, the energy-momentum-mass tensor. The momentum tensor leads to a reduced form, where we obtain the potentials of thermodynamics. $\Leftarrow$ ==It is the key==
**First and second principles**
- Need to generalise the divergence in a covariant form, divergence of the momentum tensor. This leads to the conservation of mass, linear momentum, and conservation of energy. This geometry setting gives the opportunity to define a reversible medium as a theorem. 
- For the second principle, use the additive decomposition of the momentum tensor, into a reversible part, and an irreversible part. After calculations, obtain a local production of entropy, which is a Galilean invariant. It also recovers the classical form of the Clausius-Duhem inequality.
