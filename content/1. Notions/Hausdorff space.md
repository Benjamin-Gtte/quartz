$M$ is a Hausdorff space if, for any set of distinct points $q,p \in M$, there exists two [[open set]]s $U,V \subseteq M$ , disjoint, such that $q\in U$ and $p \in V$. 

*This definition can be written in terms of [[neighbourhood]]s.*
$M$ is a Hausdorff space if for any set of distinct point $q,p\in M$, there exists two neighbourhoods $U,V$, respectively of $q$ and $p$, that are disjoint.
