Let a  topology $\mathcal{T}$ on a set $X$ be generated by a basis $\mathcal{B}$ if $\mathcal{B}$ is a [[basis for a topology]] $\mathcal{T}$. It means that, any subset $U$ of $X$ is said to be open in $X$ (namely is an element of the [[topology]]) if there exists a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B$ and $B \subset U$.
