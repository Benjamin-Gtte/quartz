Given a [[coordinate chart]] $(U,\varphi)$.
- The open set $U$ is called a **coordinate domain** of each of its points. 
- The map $\varphi$ is called **(local) coordinate map**, and the component functions $(x^1,\dots,x^n)$ of $\varphi$, defined by $\varphi(p) = (x^1(p),\dots,x^n(p))$ are called **local coordinates on $U$**
