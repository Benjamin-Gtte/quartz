Let $X$ be a set. A collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ is said to be a basis for a [[topology]] on $X4$ if it verifies the following conditions:
1. For every element $x\in X$, there is at list one basis element $\mathcal{B}$ containing $x$.
2. If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements ${B}_1$ and ${B}_2$, then there exists a third basis element ${B}_3$ containing $x$ such that ${B}_3 \subset {B}_1 \cap {B}_2$.
