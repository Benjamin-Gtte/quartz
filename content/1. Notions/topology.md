A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:
- $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$;
- The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$;
- The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

A topology can be defined thanks to a [[basis for a topology]], creating the notion of [[topology generated by a basis]].
