A set $X$ for which a [[topology]] has been specified is called a topological space. ![[Pasted image 20241115153229.png|500]]![[Pasted image 20241115153247.png|500]]In the case of Fig. 12.2, we have the union of $\{a\}$  and $\{b\}$ = $\{a,b\}$ which is not within the topology, defined by $\{a\}$, $\{b\}$ and $X$.
