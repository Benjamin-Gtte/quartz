**â™» Stage of growth**
- ðŸŒ± Seedling (The plant starts as a seed, which contains a tiny embryo and stored nutrients ==starting point of a new idea== + When conditions are favorable, the seed absorbs water and swells, breaking through its outer coat first moments of understanding a concept)
- ðŸª´ vegetative growth (The plant focuses on growing bigger and stronger ==repetition==)
- ðŸŒ³ Maturity
